# Face_Identifier
Haarcascade is a file that cascades on the given input file and funnels down on every pixel until a bunch of pixels for what the algorithm thinks to be a face-like structure.This 
haarcascade is a file with trained data that is capable of doing what was mention above.The detector uses haar features to differentiate each pixels and find a relation between
each of them to create a template for something that looks like a face.The algorithm is fed both faces and non-faces and then it learns what makes a face and what does not.
